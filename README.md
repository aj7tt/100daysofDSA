## Choosing the Right Data Structure to solve problems?💻

```
To decide which data structure you need in what case, you should know about them in the first place.

You need to know:
- Which  DS exist
- What they are good for
- How they work
- Their runtime characteristics (time and space complexity)
- Their pros && Cons.
